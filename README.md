# Pyvolcanesmex
This a code to map all the volcanos in mexico. Using matplotlib and folium.

In this project we establish that the purpose is to locate the polygon that covers the ground where a volcano is found, parting from the center of its crater. For this to exe-cute we are creating a program in code lan-guage that can direct the user to locate a certain volcano. This directs the program to insert the coordinates of the polygons that compose all the area that makes up the vol-cano. The polygons mentioned are satellite images in an aster file that are retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spec-troradiometer (MODIS) found online in the U.S. geological survey platform.
